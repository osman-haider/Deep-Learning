It learns patterns from data and can make decisions or predictions based on what it has learned.\n","\n","### Think of it like this:\n","\n","\n","*   You show it lots of examples (like images of cats and dogs).\n","*   It \"learns\" from these examples.\n","*   Later, it can tell you if a new image is a cat or a dog.\n","\n","\n","### How Does a Neural Network Work?\n","\n","A Neural Network has the following components:\n","\n","\n","*   Input Layer:\n","    *   This is where the data comes in. For example, an image is converted into numbers (pixels), and these numbers enter the network.\n","*   Hidden Layers:\n","    *   These are like \"workers\" who do calculations and extract patterns from the data.\n","    *   Each layer contains small units called neurons, and these neurons are connected to each other.\n","*   List item\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","This is where the data comes in.

It introduces non-linearity so the network can learn complex patterns.\n","Training: Teaching the network by showing it data and adjusting weights to improve accuracy.\n","Loss Function: A way to measure how far the predictions are from the actual answers.\n","Optimization: A process to reduce the loss (make the network better)."],"metadata":{"id":"iAC2rO2E1Siy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n","\n","# 1.
